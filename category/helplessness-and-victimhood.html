      What Are Narrative Frames of Helplessness and Victimhood?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Narrative frames of helplessness and victimhood aim to convince us that we
      lack control over our lives, emotions, and decisions. They create a
      mindset of hopelessness, leaving us dependent on external factors or
      individuals for validation, rescue, or progress. Some common narrative
      frames in this category include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Circumstances control your destiny completely."</li>
      <li>"Others dictate your emotional state permanently."</li>
      <li>"You must wait for someone else to save you."</li>
      <li>"You are incapable of overcoming life’s trials."</li>
      <li>"You can never escape your past."</li>
      <li>"You have no agency or responsibility whatsoever."</li>
      <li>"You must rely entirely on external rescue."</li>
      <li>"You are inevitably doomed by fate."</li>
      <li>"Life is unfair, and you can't influence outcomes."</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="identify">Spotting the Signs: How to Identify These Frames?</h2>
    <p>
      Look out for repeated occurrences of messages which suggest you are
      powerless, either communicated directly or subtly through stories and
      images. Here are some key indicators that can help identify these frames:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Statements that make you feel incapable of influencing your outcomes
      </li>
      <li>
        Language that portrays you as a victim of circumstances, permanence of
        emotional distress
      </li>
      <li>
        Discouragement of individual action, responsibility or self-efficacy
      </li>
      <li>
        Narratives which exaggerate the permanence of defeat or victimization
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="actors">Principal Evil Actors: Who Might Use These Frames?</h2>
    <p>
      Particular groups and individuals who might employ these narrative frames:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Toxic relationship partners: In various relationships, manipulative
        individuals might use these frames to maintain a power imbalance, making
        the other partner more dependent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Political figures: In some cases, politicians or political groups might
        exploit perceptions of victimhood or helplessness to gain support or
        sympathy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Media platforms: Some media outlets may use these frames to generate
        fear and increase their audience's reliance on them for news and
        opinions.
      </li>
      <li>
        False saviors, cult leaders, and gurus: False saviors may capitalize on
        feelings of dependence by offering themselves as the "source of rescue."
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="examples">Simple Scenario Examples</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Relationship</h3>
        <p>Your partner saying, "Without me, you can't manage on your own."</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Political Arena</h3>
        <p>
          A politician insisting that only their policies can save you, implying
          that you can't change your situation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Media</h3>
        <p>
          News sources framing events in a helpless or hopeless light, inspiring
          fear and dependence on continued news updates.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>False Savior</h3>
        <p>
          Cult leaders saying, "I am the only one who can lead you to
          salvation."
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Protecting Your Mental Wellbeing</h2>

      Remember, your empowerment lies in your understanding of these tactics. By
      recognizing these frames, you protect yourself from individuals seeking to
