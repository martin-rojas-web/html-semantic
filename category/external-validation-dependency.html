    <h2>Introduction: Understanding Psychological Manipulation</h2>
    <p>
      Psychological manipulation is a potent threat that takes advantage of
      emotions, weaknesses, and insecurities to serve another individual's
      interest. In this piece, we delve into one of the more covert forms of
      manipulation, namely 'narrative frames of external validation dependency.'
      These frames aim to weaken personal autonomy and make one's self-worth
      entirely conditional on external approval. By the end of the article,
      you'll be able to recognize these frames, identify potential actors who
      might use them and take steps to protect yourself.
    </p>

    <h2 id="description">
      What Are Narrative Frames of External Validation Dependency?
    </h2>
    <p>
      These frames revolve around tying your self-worth to the validation and
      opinions of others. They work subtly to erode self-confidence and
      decision-making abilities, making you heavily dependent on external
      feedback for self-worth. Here are a few examples of such narrative frames:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"You must always please everyone around you."</li>
      <li>"Approval from others defines your worth."</li>
      <li>"Criticism from others means you are worthless."</li>
      <li>"You cannot self-validate; outsiders must confirm your value."</li>
      <li>
        "You should change yourself completely according to others' desires."
      </li>
      <li>"Always put others’ perception above your self-respect."</li>
      <li>"You must pursue popularity above authenticity."</li>
      <li>"Your happiness depends entirely on others’ approval."</li>
      <li>"Others’ opinions about you always outweigh your intuition."</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="identify">Spotting the Signs: How to Identify These Frames?</h2>
    <p>
      To recognize these frames, stay alert for language that subordinates your
      needs and preferences to others' opinions and views. Here are some common
      identifiers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Consistent denial of self-approval and validation of your opinions
      </li>
      <li>
        Excessive weightage given to outsider perspectives regardless of one's
        own beliefs
      </li>
      <li>Constant craving for external appreciation</li>
      <li>Changes in behavior or self-presentation to suit others</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="actors">Principal Evil Actors: Who Might Use These Frames?</h2>
    <p>
      The likelihood of employing these frames is greater among the following
      individuals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Manipulative partners or friends: People in relationships might use
        these frames to mold their significant others to suit their needs and
        desires.
      </li>
      <li>
        Narcissistic parents or authority figures: Individuals in authority or
        caretaking roles might deploy these frames to exert control over their
        children or those under their watch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Social media influencers: Some influencers might promote these frames to
        maintain follower engagement and secure their position as approval
        figures.
      </li>
      <li>
        Overbearing mentors: Those entrusted to guide others professionally may
        fall into using these frames for control.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="examples">Simple Scenario Examples</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Relationship</h3>
        <p>
          A partner coercing you to cut your hair by declaring you'd be
          "worthier of love" if you did.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Family</h3>
        <p>
          Parents dismissing your hobbies or interests because they're "weird"
          or "unworthy" in their opinion.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Social Media</h3>
        <p>
          Influencers persuading followers that their approval is paramount and
          that their validation is necessary for a complete sense of self.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Professional</h3>
        <p>
          A mentor pushing you to conform your work style to their personal
          preferences, even if it doesn't fit your strengths.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Protecting Your Mental Wellbeing</h2>
    <p>
      Becoming aware of such frames liberates you from undue external
      dependencies. Independent decisions, self-affirmations, and sustaining
      self-acceptance regardless of external criticism fosters resilience
      against such manipulation. Building on these fundamentals, safeguard your
      mental wellbeing against individuals seeking to erode your autonomy for
      personal gain.
