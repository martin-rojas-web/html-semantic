    <h2>Introduction: Understanding Psychological Manipulation</h2>
    <p>
      Psychological manipulation seeks to control your emotions, beliefs, and
      actions to benefit the manipulator. Narrative frames are one manipulative
      tool that shape your understanding of situations and guide your responses.
      This specific category, Frames of Defeat & Resignation, promotes feelings
      of powerlessness, despair, and a lack of agency by emphasizing the
      futility of effort and the permanence of negative circumstances.
    </p>

    <h2 id="description">What Are Narrative Frames of Defeat & Resignation?</h2>
    <p>
      Narrative frames of Defeat & Resignation are statements or stories that
      focus on the inevitability of failure and the impossibility of growth or
      improvement. These frames may create feelings of resignation and
      hopelessness, discouraging individuals from taking action or pursuing
      goals. Examples of frames within this category include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"There is no possibility of improvement whatsoever."</li>
      <li>"You're trapped in your current circumstances permanently."</li>
      <li>"Giving up is always a justified response."</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="identify">Spotting the Signs: How to Identify These Frames?</h2>
    <p>
      These frames use language that highlights the futility of effort,
      emphasizes feelings of being trapped, and denies the potential for
      personal growth. They often present an overly pessimistic outlook,
      suggesting that negative outcomes are inevitable regardless of actions
      taken.
    </p>

    <h2 id="actors">Principal Evil Actors: Who Might Use These Frames?</h2>
    <p>
      Individuals or groups who benefit from your inaction or unwillingness to
      challenge the status quo may employ these frames. Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Abusive partners who discourage you from leaving the relationship.
      </li>
      <li>
        Workplace managers who prevent employees from advocating for fair
        treatment.
      </li>
      <li>Corrupt leaders who wish to maintain power without challenge.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="examples">Simple Scenario Examples</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Abusive Relationship</h3>
        <p>
          An abusive spouse insisting that there's no point in trying to improve
          the relationship because it will never change.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Workplace Dynamics</h3>
        <p>
          A boss who tells employees it's useless to ask for better working
          conditions because the company will never listen.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Political Context</h3>
        <p>
          A politician who claims that nothing can be done to address a social
          issue and that accepting it is the only option.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Protecting Your Mental Wellbeing</h2>
    <p>
      To protect yourself from these frames, adopt a growth mindset and embrace
      challenge and resilience. Recognize that while some circumstances are more
      difficult to change than others, growth and improvement are always
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surround yourself with people who encourage personal development and
      believe in your potential. Seek out inspiring stories of successful
      individuals who overcame adversity, and remember that success is often a
      process of perseverance and adaptation. Practice optimistic thinking and
      develop problem-solving skills to tackle challenges with a can-do
      attitude.
