    <h2>Introduction: Understanding Psychological Manipulation</h2>
    <p>
      Psychological manipulation seeks to influence your thoughts, emotions, and
      decisions to benefit the manipulator. Narrative frames are a common tool
      used in manipulation, shaping your perspective and guiding your behavior.
      This category, Frames Promoting Passivity & Inaction, encourages avoidance
      and stagnation by emphasizing the potential dangers of action, promoting
      comfort zone preservation, and discouraging risk-taking or challenge.
    </p>

    <h2 id="description">
      What Are Narrative Frames Promoting Passivity & Inaction?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Narrative frames of Passivity & Inaction are stories or statements that
      advocate for avoiding action, maintaining the status quo, and prioritizing
      security over growth. These frames often present uncertainty, change, and
      risk-taking as inherently dangerous, promoting inaction as the safest and
      most reasonable choice. Examples of frames within this category include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Waiting passively resolves life's most important challenges."</li>
      <li>
        "You shouldn't act until you're absolutely sure about everything."
      </li>
      <li>"Comfort zone preservation is more important than growth."</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="identify">Spotting the Signs: How to Identify These Frames?</h2>
    <p>
      These frames often use language that promotes hesitation, doubt, and a
      fear of change. They emphasize the potential negative consequences of
      action, while downplaying the risks of stagnation or missed opportunities.
    </p>

    <h2 id="actors">Principal Evil Actors: Who Might Use These Frames?</h2>
    <p>
      These frames may be employed by individuals or organizations that benefit
      from maintaining the status quo or discouraging individual growth.
      Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Overprotective parents who hinder their children's independence by
        emphasizing the dangers of the unknown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fear-mongering media outlets that sensationalize risks to generate
        viewer engagement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Controlling partners who isolate their significant others from new
        experiences to preserve power dynamics.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="examples">Simple Scenario Examples</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Overprotective Parents</h3>
        <p>
          Parents who discourage their child from exploring new interests,
          citing safety concerns.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Fear-Mongering Media</h3>
        <p>
          A news station that exaggerates the danger of a new virus to increase
          viewership.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Controlling Partner</h3>

    <h2>Protecting Your Mental Wellbeing</h2>
    <p>
      To protect yourself from these frames, embrace growth, resilience, and
      adaptability. Develop a positive mindset, understanding that uncertainty
      and discomfort are natural parts of life that often lead to rewarding
      experiences.
